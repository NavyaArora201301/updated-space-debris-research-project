# updated-space-debris-research-project
Analyzing Satellite Kinematics in the Earthâ€™s Orbits using Publicly Available Data 
This project uses publicly available datasets (Kaggle) on satellite positions and velocities to study orbital mechanics, collision risks, and the rising challenge of space debris. It examines the Kessler Syndrome, presents data-driven insights through visualizations, and proposes sustainable management strategies. Added a literature-backed AI scope (XGBoost, LSTM, CNNs, RL) to explore how machine learning can enhance trajectory forecasting, debris detection, and autonomous collision avoidance, ensuring a safer orbital environment.
It is an upgraded version to space-debris-research-project
